Q: Suppose that we create an array A of GameEntry objects, which has an integer scores field,
    and we clone A and store the result in an array B.
    If we then im- mediately set A[4].score equal to 550,
    what is the score value of the GameEntry object referenced by B[4]?

My answer: While we are cloning the array object A, creating a new array object in memory with the
reference variable name B pointing to a different array than reference variable name A, the cloning process is shallow.
Therefore, the GameEntry objects referenced within the array are not also cloned, but reference the same objects in memory
as the original array. Therefore, setting the score of A[4], will affect the score in B[4].
