Question:
Write a pseudocode description of a method that reverses an array of n integers,
so that the numbers are listed in the opposite order than they were before,
and compare this method to an equivalent Java method for doing the same thing.



method reverseIntegerArray(int[] integerArray){

    // create a new empty array with the same length as the original
    int[] reverseArray = new int[integerArray.length];

    int j = 0; // index that goes in ascending order

    for (int i = integerArray.length - 1; i >=0; i--){ // index in descending order
        reverseArray[j] = integerArray[i];
        j++;
    }

    return reverseArray;

}
